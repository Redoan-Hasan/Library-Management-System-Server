### Borrow Endpoints

#### 📥 Borrow a Book

- **POST** `/api/borrow`
- **Request Body:**
  ```json

    "quantity": 2,
    "dueDate": "2025-07-18T00:00:00.000Z"
  }
  ```
- **Business Logic:**
  - Checks if the book exists and has enough available copies.
  - Deducts the requested quantity from the book’s copies.
  - If copies become 0, sets `available` to `false` (via instance method).
  - Saves the borrow record.
- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "message": "Book borrowed successfully",
    "data": { ...borrow }
  }
  ```

  ```json
  {
    "success": true,

    "data": [
      {
        "book": {
          "title": "The Theory of Everything",
          "isbn": "9780553380163"
        },
        "totalQuantity": 5
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

---

## ⚠️ Error Handling

All error responses follow this structure:

```json
{
  "message": "Validation failed",
  "success": false,
  "error": { ... }
}
```

---

## 🧩 Mongoose Middleware & Methods

- **Instance Method:**  
  `updateBookAvailability` on Book model automatically updates `available` based on `copies`.
- **Middleware:**  
  `pre('save')` and `post('save')` hooks log book saves.
